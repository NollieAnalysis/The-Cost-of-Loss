# The Cost of Loss

# Project objective / description:

It is important to keep in mind that financial loss and the road back to original profit is not 1:1. In other words, the percentage it takes to return to a beginning position will always be larger than the percentage of loss it took to move you away from that beginning position.

For example, you begin a position with the following profit profile:

Revenue = $100.00

Cost = $90.00

Profit = $10.00

Markup Percentage = 11.11%

Margin Percentage = 10.00%

As the position develops, unseen issues become a reality causing profit to decrease incrementally. As shown in the attached table and visual, the percentage needed to return to original profit diverges from percentage loss as percentage loss increases in the negative direction. In these circumstances, fundamentally, increased revenue and or decreased cost will restore profits (easier said than done), although, risk registers and accompanying risk responses shall be referenced for direction and criterion for position exit.
